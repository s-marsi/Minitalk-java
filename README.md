# Minitalk-java

The goal of this project is to implement a simple client-server communication system using Java and TCP sockets. It aims to demonstrate the fundamentals of network communication, including how data is exchanged between a client and a server. This project helps in understanding socket programming and networking principles in Java.

## Description :
- This project implements a client-server communication system using Java and TCP sockets. It includes the development and execution of both client and server applications. The client sends requests while the server processes and responds to them.
  
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- To use this program, you need a Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system. Ensure that you have a compatible version of Java (e.g., JDK 8 or later).

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/s-marsi/Minitalk-java.git minitalk
    cd minitalk
    ```
### Usage :
   1. Open two terminal windows:
   
   - In the first terminal, run:
     ```
     java Server.java
     ```

   - In the second terminal, run:
     ```
     java Client.java
     ```
     
  After starting both the server and client, you can send a message by typing it into the client terminal. The client will send the message to the server, and the server will process and respond accordingly.
